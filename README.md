# MCPiLoad
A simple yet flawed saver and loader for MCPi

# How do I use this???
1. Get out your Raspberry Pi
2. Download this repo
3. Run 'veinreplacer.py'
4. Right-click on a DIRT platform in a corner with something interesting on top (make sure it is the corner facing negative x and positive z)
5. Wait until the program auto-exits
6. Run 'vineloader.py'
7. Right-click a DIRT platform of the same size in the same corner
8. Look at it
